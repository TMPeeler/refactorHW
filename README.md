# RefactorHW

The goal of this assignment was to take preexisting code and consolidate it using semantic HTML 

## Getting Started

I cloned a repository to my machine from the class gitlab repository and opened the index.html as well as the style.css in my code editor.

### Prerequisites

In order to accomplish the goal of this assignment, I needed to use VSCode and Gitlab as well as Github to clone a repository of the work, refactor the code in VSCode, and then commit changes as well as push and deploy using Github.

### Solving

While solving this assignment, I noticed that the HTML had many small syntax errors that either included non-existing elements or classes, as well as many poor organizational decisions. I started by renaming and relabling classes in the HTML and CSS respectively for all of the classes in the CSS that had duplicates. I made many notes in my HTML and CSS files that show what I changed and with brief explanations as to why I did or did not change them. The assignment was not particularly difficult but it did force me to read very closely to maintain or improve upon the condition of the webpage while not changing key parts of the source code.
