      <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
      <p>The dominance of mobile internet use means that users are searching for the right business as they travel, shop,
        or sit on their couch at home. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows you to increase your visibility and find
        the right customers for your business.</p>

      <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>

      <p> The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an internet
        connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives you the control
        over what potential customers see when they search for your business. </p>

      <h2>Social Media Marketing</h2>

      <p>Social media continues to have a sizable influence on buying habits. Social media marketing helps you determine
        which platforms are suited to your brand, using analytics to find the right markets and increase your lead
        generation.</p>

      <h3>Lead Generation</h3>
      <img src="./assets/images/lead-generation.png" alt="picture of a gear trickling down through a funnel into a dollar sign" />
      <p>Inbound strategies for lead generation require less work for your business, bringing customers directly to your
        website.</p>

      <h3>Brand Awareness</h3>
      <img src="./assets/images/brand-awareness.png" alt="picture of a businessperson with a light bulb head" />
      <p>Users find your business through paid and organic searches, increasing the search ranking and visibility for
        your business.</p>

      <h3>Cost Management</h3>
      <img src="./assets/images/cost-management.png" alt="picture of gear surrounded by dollar sign" />
      <p>As the search ranking for your business increases, your advertising costs decrease, and you no longer need to
        advertise your page.</p>
        <!--^^^^^ by applying benefit2 to all of these div tags it centered the text underneath each figure. I kept it because it looked neat
           but I also proposed a solution if a client really wanted it aligned to the left instead-->
        <!--^^^^^ there's something up here that's really bothering me where the css for the bar on the right side of the page with the figures doesn't go down to the same 
          part of the page that the social media marketing part does and I cannot figure out for the life of me where I can control that-->
